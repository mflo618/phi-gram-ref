**Computational Certificates for Papers by mFLO**

**1. Overview**

This repository contains the Python scripts that serve as the computational certificates for the paper **"A Geometric Resonance Condition for Gauge Group Selection"** and related works by the author.

The scripts are provided to ensure full transparency and reproducibility of the central claims, allowing any researcher to independently verify the results.

The package consists of two main components:
*   **Axiomatic Mapping Derivator (`mapping_demo.py`):** A script that formally derives the `f(N) = N+2` mapping from a set of foundational axioms.
*   **Geometric Filter (`phi_gram_ref.py`):** The primary script that implements the filter and tests harmonic doublets for static and dynamic resonance.

**2. File Descriptions**

*   `phi_gram_ref.py`: The main computational engine. Implements the Geometric Filter and performs the numerical analysis.
*   `mapping_demo.py`: A script that demonstrates the axiomatic derivation of the `f(N) = N+2` mapping.
*   `group_mapping.py`: A helper module containing function definitions used by `mapping_demo.py`.

**3. Prerequisites**

*   Python 3
*   NumPy library

You can install the necessary library with pip:
`pip install numpy`

**4. How to Reproduce the Results**

**4.1 Verifying the Axiomatic Mapping (f(N)=N+2)**
This step corresponds to Section 2 of the paper, justifying the SU(N) to harmonic mode mapping.

**Command:**
`python mapping_demo.py`

**Expected Output:**
The script will test several simple mappings against the stated axioms and show that they fail. It will then solve for the simplest affine map f(N) = N+c that satisfies all axioms, demonstrating that the unique solution is c=2.

**4.2 Reproducing the Results for "A Geometric Resonance Condition..."**
This step corresponds to the main results table in Section 5 of the paper.

**Methodology Note:** For each harmonic pair, we perform a search for the global minimum of the static resonance metric (rel_min). The dynamic stability (convergence_rate) is then evaluated at this optimal point. To ensure we are robustly testing for resonance, the `--group su3` flag is used in all cases, as this configures the search algorithm to always seek the minimum rel_min.

**Test 1: SU(2) Viability (Pass)**
This command tests the harmonic doublet (4, 5).

**Command:**
`python phi_gram_ref.py --harmonics 4,5 --group su3 --cesaro-start-T --check-dynamics`

**What to look for in the output:**
*   A `rel_min` value significantly below 0.03.
*   A `Convergence Rate` below 3e-10.
*   The final `Verdict` should be "Viable Resonance (Pass)".

**Test 2: SU(3) Viability (Pass)**
This command tests the harmonic doublet (5, 6).

**Command:**
`python phi_gram_ref.py --harmonics 5,6 --group su3 --cesaro-start-T --check-dynamics`

**What to look for in the output:**
*   A `rel_min` value significantly below 0.03.
*   A `Convergence Rate` below 3e-10.
*   The final `Verdict` should be "Viable Resonance (Pass)".

**Test 3: SU(4) Viability (Fail)**
This command tests the harmonic doublet (6, 7).

**Command:**
`python phi_gram_ref.py --harmonics 6,7 --group su3 --cesaro-start-T --check-dynamics`

**What to look for in the output:**
*   A `rel_min` value that is very small (passing the static test).
*   A `Convergence Rate` that is above 3e-10.
*   The final `Verdict` should be "Unstable Resonance (Fail)" due to the failure of the dynamic stability criterion.

**4.3 Reproducing Inputs for "A Geometric Dynamic-Signature Bridge..."**
The paper "A Geometric Dynamic-Signature Bridge from a MÃ¶bius-Twist Projector to LST 1-Loop Vacuum Stability" uses the `convergence_rate` outputs as a key input.

The necessary values are generated by the commands in the section above:
*   The `convergence_rate` for the SU(3) case is found in the output of Test 2.
*   The `convergence_rate` for the SU(4) case is found in the output of Test 3.

Running these commands allows for a full, independent verification of the inputs used in the bridge paper's calculations.
