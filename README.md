# phi-gram-ref
This little tool runs a **fair test** that compares two patterns called **SU(3)** and **SU(4)**. You don’t need to know the math—just read the traffic‑light style summary it prints.  End‑to‑end validation of the geometric filter (Sections 2–4) and the one‑loop bridge for SU(3) vs SU(4), with ablations, stability checks, and transparent scans.
