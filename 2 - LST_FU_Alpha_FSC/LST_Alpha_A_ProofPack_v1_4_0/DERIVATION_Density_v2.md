# DERIVATION — Electron Density Certificate (v2.0)

We certify the geometry-side factor for the α-closure:
\[
G \;=\; \frac{1}{2}\,\mathrm{QC}_2(e)\,\Big(\frac{\rho}{\rho_{\min}}\Big)\,\phi^6.
\]

## 1) QC₂(e) is a *count* (multiplicity), not an amplitude

- In the U(1) sector, the electron corresponds to a single, oriented one-cycle defect on the φ-phase sheet.
- The charge is the integral of a closed 1-form (a flux) over that cycle; its multiplicity (how many cycles) is a **topological integer**.
- Therefore **QC₂(e) = 1** for a singly charged state.

**Why not “QC₂ = 2φ”?** The “Core(2)=2φ” factor in the mass formula is a *geometric amplitude* that already participates in the
dilation encoded by the “Scale”. Putting “Core” inside QC₂ **double-counts** the same geometric content. The bridge test shows
that mistake amplifies G by ~10⁸.

## 2) Area-law for the density at the Thomson point

- The interaction certificate uses a *transverse* projector; the matched geometry is a **sheet density**: ρ ≡ (topological count) / (area of support).
- On the φ-sheet, let the induced 2D metric be γ. A sector-wide homothety (“Scale”) acts as γ → λ² γ for some λ = Scale.
  The area form transforms as \(\sqrt{\det \gamma}\,d^2\xi \to \lambda^2 \sqrt{\det \gamma}\,d^2\xi\).
- The topological **count** (the defect multiplicity) is conserved under smooth metric deformations; hence the density transforms as
\[
\frac{\rho}{\rho_{\min}} \;=\; \frac{\text{count}/(\lambda^2\!A_{\min})}{\text{count}/A_{\min}} \;=\; \frac{1}{\lambda^2} \;=\; \frac{1}{\text{Scale}^2}.
\]

## 3) Certificate

\[
\boxed{\mathrm{QC}_2(e)=1},\qquad \boxed{\ \frac{\rho}{\rho_{\min}} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{Scale}^2}\ }.
\]
Therefore
\[
G(\mathrm{Scale}) \;=\; \frac{1}{2}\phi^6\,\frac{1}{\mathrm{Scale}^2},\qquad
\alpha^{-1} \;=\; \frac{1}{15\pi\,G(\mathrm{Scale})}.
\]

This is α-free by construction and falsifiable: change the metric dilation and the predicted α^{-1} moves accordingly.
